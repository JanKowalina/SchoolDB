# School Database

The School Database project consists of several SQL files for creating and manipulating a database using MS SQL Server. The project includes the following files:

1. `create.sql`: This file contains the SQL statements for creating the necessary tables in the database. It creates tables for teachers, students, courses, TSC (Teacher-Student-Course), and other related entities.

2. `insert.sql`: This file contains SQL statements for inserting sample data into the tables.

3. `queries.sql`: This file contains a collection of SQL queries that retrieve information from the database. It includes queries to answer various questions related to teachers, students, courses, and TSC relationships.

4. `drop.sql`: This file contains SQL statements for dropping tables and databases.

## Usage Instructions

1. Make sure you are preferably using `MS SQL Server`.

2. Create Tables by executing `create.sql`.

3. Insert Sample Data using `insert.sql`.

4. Execute `queries.aql if you want to retrieve information or perform analysis on the data.

5. You can drop whole database by executing `drop.sql` script.
